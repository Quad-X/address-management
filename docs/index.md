## Address Management at QuadX

### Streamlining through address standards and new Postal Code

#### Current Situation:
There are more than 42,000 barangays, 1,634 cities and municipalities in the Philippines, yet the 4-digit
Zipcode cannot uniquely identify these locations. 

This adds to the friction that already exists in the PH
eCommerce landscape as non-standard address information is passed from consumer to service
providers,

#### Opportunity:
Thereâ€™s tremendous benefit to participants (e.g. consumers, eCommerce platforms, Payments, Logistics
providers, etc) if the industry adopts a more granular standard found in more mature markets.

Less time is required for consumers and merchants to provide address info translating to reduced risk in
failed deliveries or improper routing.
