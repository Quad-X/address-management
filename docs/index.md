## Ensuring effective nation-wide delivery through Philippine address guidelines and a more effective Postal Code

### Current Situation:
Online shopping will no doubt become part of the Filipino lifestyle, just as social media and smartphones. One estimate states that approximately 80% of the online purchases are from provincial consumers. With thousands of online sites, millions of consumers, no address standard, and a limited 4-digit postal coding system -- a significant percentage of online orders have undeliverable addresses.

The Philippines has more than 42,000 barangays, 1,634 cities and municipalities, and 81 provinces, yet the decades old 4-digit
Zipcode has not been modernized to provide for a unique system to identify these locations. 

### Opportunity:
There’s tremendous benefit to consumers if the industry participants (e.g. eCommerce platforms, Payments, Logistics
Services, etc) adopt a more effective address guidelines that are designed to streamline processes that ensure accurate and on-time deliveries.

Furthermore, efficiency gains can be extended to enable auto-fill of customer address information. As we aim for 100% address accuracy, Logistics providers (3PLs) will be able to reduce wastage through improper routing or multiple delivery attempts.

### Proposed Solution

Since 2018, QuadX has been working with other industry participants to align on a set of address guidelines which were based on an existing government standard called **Philippine Standard Geographic Code** ([PSGC](https://psa.gov.ph/)), which is part of the [Philippine Statistics Authority](https://psa.gov.ph/).  

### Benefits

#### Granularity
With a simple string, XCode can describe a location up to any barangay in the Philippines. The province code, the first 2 characters, is an easy to memorize mnemonics of the province name. If you want to see the mnemonics table you can jump to “Province mnemonics” section. The city code is a 2 digit representation of the city after the province code. The District Code is a 3 digit representation of the district after the city code.

#### Simplicity
Unlike the traditional 4-Digit postal code, Xcode conveys information without adding too many characters. The simplicity helps remove inconsistencies in address input.

#### Comprehensive List 
Includes the latest location changes from Province (Davao Occidental) to District level (Bgy. Madilay-dilay, Tanay, Rizal). XCode is compliant to Philippines Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)
